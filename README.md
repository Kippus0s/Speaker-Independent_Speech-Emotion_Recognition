# Speaker-Independent Speech Emotion Recognition
For the final project of my Bachelor's of Science in Computing & IT, I worked on a Machine Learning (ML) project entitled "Investigating Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to Speech Emotion Recognition".

This project was created to verify the integrity of my results, and as an updated and refactored version of the original implementation. The project has been refactored and reorganised, allowing the same components to work across the different dataset, and with command line arguments modifying hyperparameter values. I hope it can be of assistance to others embarking undertaking ML-based or ML-assisted research, and especially Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research. 

# Instructions

All scripts are designed to be cross-platform. However as of now tensorflow is effectively linux-only due to CUDA compatability, if you circumvent this by disabling such functionality you may see different results to those purported here.

1. Download the dataset(s).
   
2. Extract the dataset(s) into your project root directory, preserving the original dataset structure as follows: 
```
Project_root/EmoDB/wav/audiofile.wav
Project_root/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release_withoutVideos/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/etc...
Project_root/SAVEE/AudioData/JE/audiofile.wav 
Project_root/RAVDESS/Actor_01/audiofile.wav the upper-most folder for each each dataset your project directory
It is essential this is performed as above, as file paths are used rather than recursively scanning the directory for filenames, as certain datasets (namely IEMOCAP) have multiple identical files in different folders

```

"RAVDESS" and "SAVEE", which should be the case if you simply extracted the dataset archives directly into your project directory.

4. Download the csv files relevant for the datasets you are interested in, including: emodb.csv iemocap.csv savee.csv and ravdess.csv, place these csv files in your project directory
on the same level as the dataset folders.
Do not modify the original dataset's files or directory structure

5. To create the baseline models using the traditional ML approach with openSMILE, run train_baselines.py
See train_baselines.py for instructions and commandline argument explanations. 

6. Deep Learning model preprocesssing and training To test a model, you must first preprocess the dataset
   This is performed via preprocess_dataset.py, the arguments required are given and explained within that script.
   
7. Train the model using train_model.py, again from the commandline

8. Finally, once you have have trained mulitple models, you can create and test an post-decision ensemble using ensemble.py
   The training script will have saved predictions in a fixed format and  these will be located and used by ensemble.py depending
   on the models specified.


train_model.py and ensemble.py will print results to the command line, and a confusion matrix will also be saved to confusion_matrices folder created in your working directory for you to view.

# Project Summary 
The project compared the traditional ML approach to SER with that of the modern Deep Learning (DL) approach. The study stands out amongst many contemporary work in the domain by virtue of being speaker-independent. That is, the model's training, validation and test data were segmented by speaker rather than purely by a arbritary percentage of the total dataset size. As a result, the model was not exposed to audio samples from the same voice that featured in validation or test data. This is because peaker-specific qualities "leak" into the learning process in speaker-dependent studies where training data includes samples from all speakers in the total dataset. Speaker-independent models usually do not perform on par with speaker-independent models, but an SER model can not be considered truly generalisable if it is speaker-dependent. 

The traditional ML approach was that of utilising handcrafted features, in this case I used OpenSMILE (open-source Speech and Music Interpretation by Large-space Extraction) to extract features according to the emobase feature set, and these features were then used to train a logistic regression classifier. 

For the DL approach, I utilised a simple approach relative to the state of the art, my project utilises predominantly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), however I trained on three data representations separately, the raw waveforms (WAV), Mel Spectrograms, and Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFFCs). During my work I noticed that different models, especially from each of the different data representations, would often excel or struggle especially with certain emotions in particular, and it was rare that all the emotions were learned with a similar level of success. I therefore create a "post-fusion" or "late-fusion" ensemble model, by aggregating the class-probabilties (predictions) of the best-performing models for each of the data representations. In this way I demonstrated that a simple aggregate model can improve upon my single best-performing individual models. 

Results were compared across the four datasets, between the CNN models and the different data representations, and between the Dland traditional ML classifier.

Most of the time on my project was spent researching, and experimenting with data preprocessing optimisations, for example regarding neural network architecture optimisations for the CNNs, and after multiple iterations the DL approach outperformed the traditional ML approach despite it's leveraging of heuristic features. 

Four datasets for SER were used, EmoDB, IEMOCAP, SAVEE, and RAVDESS, and between them I try and capture a balance and variety in dataset attributes. 

In conclusion, results support the view that deep learning techniques achieve superior performance on speaker-independent speech emotion recognition compared to traditional ML approaches that rely on domain knowledge via handcrafted audio features. However, this study did not use handcrafted features at all in a DL model, and yet this approach has been shown to be succesful, in both standalone models and as part of an ensemble with other DL models using different data representations.

# Comparison With Contemporary Research

I compared my results with other Speaker Independent (SI) studies. The EmoDB ensemble performs among the top performing speaker independent models, despite using a relatively simple and lightweight approach. I found only one work which outperformed my EmoDB ensemble, Amjad et al. 2021 achieved 92.65% WAR, compared to my model's 91% WAR. Xu et al. 2022 also reported 90.61% Accuracy and Farooq et al. 2020 reported 90.5%. 

The other ensembles did not perform as well relative to modern research, for RAVDESS the top contemporaries include Amjad et al. 2021 (82.75% WAR), Sayed et al. 2025 (73.75% Acc), and Farooq et al. 2020 (73.5% WAR). All show demonstrably higher accuracy, at around 10-20% higher than my own. 

However, SI studies on RAVDESS were extremely rare, and two of these models used AlexNet pre-trained network, and Sayed used a CNN+LSTM hybrid model which is somewhat more expensive to train. 

My SAVEE ensemble was outperformed by Amjad et al. 2021 (75.38% WAR) and Farooq et al. 2020 (66.90% WAR). This dataset was even rarer as a choice of SI study than RAVDESS. 

IEMOCAP appeared to the most popular dataset for SI SER, and I found the largest number of studies which outperformed my own. My approach seemed to perform relatively poorly on this dataset compared to the others. IEMOCAP is much different to the other three datasets examined, and proves to be among the most challenging of all the SER datasets. The models which outperformed my own all used increasingly more complex techniques such as leveraging pre-trained AlexNets, hybrid feature extraction and feature selection, multi-task learning, pre-trained wav2vec, and multi-head attention. The models I compared with my own that achieved greater accuracies are as follows:
