# Speaker-Independent Speech Emotion Recognition
For the final project of my Bachelor's of Science in Computing & IT, I worked on a Machine Learning (ML) project entitled "Investigating Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to Speech Emotion Recognition".

This project was created to prove the integrity of my results, and as an updated and refactored version of the original implementation. The project has been refactored and reorganised, allowing the same components to work across the different dataset, and with command line arguments modifying hyperparameter values. I believe the this study will be of assistance to others embarking on ML-based or ML-assisted research, and especially Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research. 

# Instructions

All scripts are designed to be cross-platform. However as of now tensorflow is effectively linux-only due to CUDA compatibility, if you circumvent this by disabling such functionality you may see different results to those purported here.

1. Download the SER dataset(s), and download this repository. (If you are only interested in verifying the post-decision fusion ensemble results, you can simply download the model_predictions folder and scripts from this repository and run ensemble.py from the command-line using the arguments explained in the comments of ensemble.py)
   
2. Extract the dataset(s) into your project's "datasets" directory, preserving the original dataset structure as follows: 

   ```
   your_root_folder/datasets/EmoDB/wav/audiofile.wav
   your_root_folder/datasets/IEMOCAP/IEMOCAP_full_release_withoutVideos/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/etc...
   your_root_folder/datasets/SAVEE/AudioData/JE/audiofile.wav 
   your_root_folder/datasets/RAVDESS/Actor_01/audiofile.wav 
   ```

   Rather than search for audio files by name, the scripts will iterate over a CSV file which contains a list of all audio samples used, including a path to said file. This is because the directory structure of certain datasets can be quite complex, as they denote dataset      metadata such as the speaker identity, or the emotion that the particular sample conveys.

   Therefore, It is essential this step is performed so your dataset structure is as above. This is because file paths are used to directly access audio samples, and the path to said filenames needs to match that of the paths in the CSV file for each dataset. 

   For example, make sure you do not have duplicate parent directory for a dataset such as "EmoDB/EmoDB/wav/etc" and IEMOCAP's root directory is IEMOCAP and not "IEMOCAP_full_release_without..."
   For SAVEE,RAVDESS and EmoDB you can simply extract the dataset archives you obtained in step 1 into the datasets folder and the structure will be identical without any user intervention required.

   **Special note for IEMOCAP:** You may need to create an "IEMOCAP" directory inside your "datasets" folder and extract the dataset there. Refer to the example dataset structure above. Other changes may be required depending on the version of IEMOCAP you have acquired. For example for IEMOCAP version that includes video, you will need to modify the upper level folders         slightly. These changes are extremely simple, yet easier and safer than modifying the file paths stored in each row in the iemocap.csv that dataset_preprocess.py refers to. Simply refer to the structure I have outlined above for IEMOCAP, and make that your own is        identical.

3. Download the csv files relevant for the datasets you are interested in, including: emodb.csv iemocap.csv savee.csv and ravdess.csv, place these csv files in your project directory
   on the same level as the dataset folders.
   Do not modify the original dataset's files or directory structure

4. To create the baseline models that utilise the traditional ML approach with openSMILE, run train_baselines.py
See train_baselines.py for instructions and explanations of the necessary arguments

5. For the Deep Learning modes, you must first preprocess the dataset. This is performed with preprocess_dataset.py, the arguments required are given and explained within that script's source code.
   To recreate my results refer to the DL_Models.md documentation in /models/ and select the appropriate sample rate and sample duration, for a given model. Depending on the dataset, it may also be neccesary to perform this step twice with and without Z-score normalisation    on the dataset, as certain models benefited from this, while others did not.
   
7. Train the model using train_model.py - If you wish to recreate my results refer to the DL_Models.md document in /models/ and input the arguments I provide for a given model.

8. Finally, once you have have trained multiple models, you can create and test a post-decision ensemble using ensemble.py
   The training script will have saved predictions in a fixed format and  these will be located and used by ensemble.py depending
   on the models specified.


train_model.py and ensemble.py will print results to the command line, and a confusion matrix will also be saved to confusion_matrices folder created in your working directory for you to view.

# Project Summary 
The project compared the traditional ML approach to SER with that of the modern Deep Learning (DL) approach. The study stands out amongst many contemporary work in the domain by virtue of being speaker-independent. That is, the model's training, validation and test data were segmented by speaker rather than purely by a arbitrary percentage of the total dataset size. As a result, the model was not exposed to audio samples from the same voice that featured in validation or test data. This is because speaker-specific qualities "leak" into the learning process in speaker-dependent studies, as in that case the training data includes samples from all speakers in the total dataset. Speaker-independent models usually do not perform on par with speaker-dependent models in terms of accuracy, but an SER model can not be considered truly generalisable if it is speaker-dependent. 

The traditional ML approach was that of utilising handcrafted features, in this case I used OpenSMILE (open-source Speech and Music Interpretation by Large-space Extraction) to extract features according to the emobase feature set, and these features were then used to train a logistic regression classifier. 

For the DL approach, I utilised a simple approach relative to the state of the art, my project utilises predominantly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), however I trained on three data representations separately, the raw waveforms (WAV), Mel Spectrograms, and Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFFCs). During my work I noticed that different models, especially from each of the different data representations, would often excel or struggle especially with certain emotions in particular, and it was rare that all the emotions were learned with a similar level of success. I therefore create a "post-fusion" or "late-fusion" ensemble model, by aggregating the class-probabilties (predictions) of the best-performing models for each of the data representations. In this way I demonstrated that a simple aggregate model can improve upon my single best-performing individual models. 

Results were compared across the four datasets, between the CNN models and the different data representations, and between the DL and traditional ML classifier.

Most of the time on my project was spent researching, and experimenting with data preprocessing optimisations, for example regarding neural network architecture optimisations for the CNNs, and after multiple iterations the DL approach outperformed the traditional ML approach despite it's leveraging of heuristic features. 

Four datasets for SER were used, EmoDB, IEMOCAP, SAVEE, and RAVDESS, and between them I try and capture a balance and variety in dataset attributes. 

In conclusion, the results support the view that deep learning techniques can achieve superior performance on speaker-independent speech emotion recognition compared to traditional machine learning approaches that rely on domain knowledge through handcrafted audio features.

However, this work did not evaluate deep learning models that incorporate handcrafted features, despite prior research showing that such approaches can be effective both as standalone models and as part of ensembles combining multiple data representations.

The study also demonstrates that even a simple post-decision ensemble can improve SER performance by aggregating the predictions from complementary models. In this case, the models included in the ensemble were selected based on overall accuracy rather than deliberately chosen to maximise diversity in class-level performance. An alternative strategy would be to design or select models that specialise in recognising different emotions, allowing each model's separate strengths to offset eachother's weaknesses.

# Comparison With Contemporary Research

I compared my results with other Speaker Independent (SI) studies. The EmoDB ensemble performs among the top performing speaker independent models, despite using a relatively simple and lightweight approach. I found only one work which outperformed my EmoDB ensemble, Amjad et al. 2021 achieved 92.65% WAR, compared to my model's 91% WAR. Xu et al. 2022 also reported 90.61% Accuracy and Farooq et al. 2020 reported 90.5%. 

The other ensembles did not perform as well relative to modern research, for RAVDESS the top contemporaries include Amjad et al. 2021 (82.75% WAR), Sayed et al. 2025 (73.75% Acc), and Farooq et al. 2020 (73.5% WAR). All show demonstrably higher accuracy, at around 10-20% higher than my own. 

However, SI studies on RAVDESS were extremely rare, and two of these models used AlexNet pre-trained network, and Sayed used a CNN+LSTM hybrid model which is somewhat more expensive to train. 

My SAVEE ensemble was outperformed by Amjad et al. 2021 (75.38% WAR) and Farooq et al. 2020 (66.90% WAR). This dataset was even rarer as a choice of SI study than RAVDESS. 

IEMOCAP appeared to the most popular dataset for SI SER, and I found the largest number of studies which outperformed my own. My approach seemed to perform relatively poorly on this dataset compared to the others. IEMOCAP is much different to the other three datasets examined, and proves to be among the most challenging of all the SER datasets. The models which outperformed my own all used increasingly more complex techniques such as leveraging pre-trained AlexNets, hybrid feature extraction and feature selection, multi-task learning, pre-trained wav2vec, and multi-head attention. The models I compared with my own that achieved greater accuracies are as follows:
